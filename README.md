## ðŸŽµ Mini Audio Loop Player

This is a simple yet interactive web-based **audio loop player** that allows users to play, switch, and pause different background audio loops using both **clicks and keyboard keys** . Itâ€™s designed to help learn how to control media elements using JavaScript DOM manipulation and event handling.

## ðŸ”§ Functionalities

- ðŸ”Š **Play Audio Loops:**

  Users can play one of three audio loops:

  - Beat Loop
  - Dark Trap Loop
  - Relaxing Guitar Loop

- ðŸ›‘ **Pause All Audio:**

  Clicking anywhere on the page outside the audio buttons or pressing the spacebar will pause all currently playing audio.

  Control the audio using keys:

  - Press `b` to play the Beat loop
  - Press `d` to play the Dark loop
  - Press `g` to play the Guitar loop
  - Press `Space` to pause all audio

- ðŸŽ¨ **Visual Feedback:**

  The currently playing button will be highlighted using a `playing` CSS class for a better user experience.
